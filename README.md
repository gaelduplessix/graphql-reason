# graphql-reason !!WIP!!

ReasonML binding for graphql-js.

Would be really cool to have a nicely typed graphql library for the server :) The plan would be to start with a binding to `graphql-js` then maybe re-implement it fully with GraphQL in order to target native build in the future.
Not sure I will ever finish this, though...
