# Reasonable GraphQL server !!WIP!!

Proof of concept for using ReasonML for building a GraphQL server.

This branch is an attempt at building a codegen tool that creates the necessary types / helper functions from a GraphQL DSL schema definition.

```js
# build Reason

yarn build

# build Js glue-code

yarn build-js
yarn start
```
